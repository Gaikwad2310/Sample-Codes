You are generating an updated version of a model performance and monitoring report using:
- A reference PDF (last quarter’s version),
- An Excel file with this quarter’s results located in the sheet/tab named “Summary”.

**Important:**
- Before writing any table or metric-related section, analyze the structure and formatting used in the PDF.
- If multiple tables are present in a section (e.g., different categories of KPIs or models), reproduce the **same number of tables** with the **same structure**.
- Replace only the values (from Excel “Summary” sheet); preserve formatting, headers, captions, footnotes, and accompanying text.

- Describe the methodology and rationale clearly.

**3.3 KPI History**  
- Build a KPI history table showing the current quarter (from Excel “Summary” tab) and previous 3 quarters (from the uploaded PDF).

**GENERAL RULES**  
- Use **only** the "Summary" tab in the Excel file for updated data  
- Follow **all formatting conventions** from the PDF: same section order, table formats, font/structure, figure/table captions  
- Do **not summarize, compress, or skip** any section  
- Make sure the final output looks like a **natural continuation of the PDF’s format**, just with new values
